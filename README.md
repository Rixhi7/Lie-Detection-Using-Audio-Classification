# Lie-Detection-Using-Audio-Classification
Deception detection has been a challenge in recent research, and developing a noncontact application for estimating physiological changes during lies is a current objective. This research project aims to use verbal modalities to develop a deception detection system using speech to distinguish between truthful and deceptive statements. Real-life trial data is converted to audio files to detect changes in modality during deception. The goal is to develop an efficient and reliable tool that can assist in lie detection and reduce human error and subjectivity in fields such as law enforcement, legal proceedings, and personnel selection
