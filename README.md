# Lie-Detection-Using-Audio-Classification
Deception detection has been a   
challenge in recent research, and developing a noncontact application for estimating physiological   
changes during lies is a current objective. This   
research project aims to use verbal modalities to   
develop a deception detection system using speech   
to distinguish between truthful and deceptive   
statements. Real-life trial data is converted to audio   
files to detect changes in modality during deception.   
The goal is to develop an efficient and reliable tool   
that can assist in lie detection and reduce human   
error and subjectivity in fields such as law   
enforcement, legal proceedings, and personnel   
selection
